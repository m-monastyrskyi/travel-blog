            "title": "Planet Earth and all life upon it, including human civilization",
            "subtitle": "The World is the Earth and all life on it, including human civilization. In a philosophical context, the 'world' is the whole of the physical Universe, or an ontological world",
            "content": "<p><h2>Philosophy</h2><p>The Garden of Earthly Delights triptych by Hieronymus Bosch (c.&thinsp;1503) shows the \"garden\" of mundane pleasures flanked by Paradise and Hell. The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a disc enclosed in a sphere.<br />In philosophy, the term world has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up reality or the physical universe. In others, it can mean have a specific ontological sense (<strong>see world disclosure</strong>). While clarifying the concept of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of Western philosophy, this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.</p><h2>Parmenides</h2><p>The traditional interpretation of Parmenides' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in doxa) is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.</p><h2>Plato</h2><p>In his Allegory of the Cave, Plato distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.</p><h2>Hegel</h2><p>In Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy of history, the expression Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.</p><h2>Schopenhauer</h2><p><em>The World as Will and Representation is the central work of Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation</em>; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.</p><h2>Wittgenstein</h2><p>Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. \"The world is everything that is the case,\" wrote Ludwig Wittgenstein in his influential Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in 1921. This definition would serve as the basis of logical positivism, with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.</p><h2>Heidegger</h2>\n" +
                "<p>Martin Heidegger, meanwhile, argued that \"the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world\". The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already \"thrown\" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of \"world disclosure\" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work Being and Time.</p><h2>Freud</h2><p>In response, Sigmund Freud proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.</p></p>",

            "title": "Things to see and do in Paris",
            "subtitle": "Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world in 2019",
            "content": "<p><p><strong>1. Go museum hopping</strong></p><p>The Louvre might get most of the attention, but there are plenty of other great museums in the city. Make sure you especially check out the Musee D&rsquo;Orsay for great impressionist work, the amazing Rodin museum, Holocaust museum (one of the best in the world), Musee D&rsquo;Orangerie (more impressionist work), and the interesting sewer museum to start. There are so many museums in the city that you won&rsquo;t run out of something to see! A museum pass is the most affordable way to do this. A two-day pass costs &euro;48 ($53 USD), a four-day pass costs &euro;62 ($69 USD), and a six-day pass costs &euro;74 ($82 USD).</p><p><strong>2. Walk the Champs Elysees</strong></p><p>This is a very prestigious avenue in Paris with cinemas, cafes, luxury specialty shops. It&rsquo;s also one of the most famous streets in the world, running down from the Arc de Triomphe to the Louvre. It is always busy and always expensive, but it&rsquo;s a great place to club hop at night or snap photos during the day. Come in the very early morning to see the place utterly deserted. It makes for great photos.</p><p><strong>3. Visit the Panth&eacute;on</strong></p><p>Located in the Latin Quarter, this neoclassical building was originally built as a church but was turned into a state burial site for France&rsquo;s heroes, like Marie Curie, Victor Hugo, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Louis Braille, and Voltaire. The scale of the building is impressive &mdash; after all, it the peristyle was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. Admission is &euro;9 ($10 USD).</p><p><strong>4. Relax in Jardin Du Luxembourg</strong></p><p>The Jardin du Luxembourg is the largest public park in Paris. The garden contains just over a hundred statues, monuments, and fountains, all scattered throughout the grounds. In the morning, you&rsquo;ll see lots of runners. At lunch on a nice day, a park full of people having a picnic (which is something I highly recommend you do!).</p>\n" +
                "<p><strong>5. View the city from Montemartre</strong></p><p>Home to starving artists for decades, Montmartre offers a stunning view of Paris, arty caf&eacute;s and bars, cobblestone streets, and the only winery within the city limits (Vignes du Clos Montmartre). It&rsquo;s one of the hipper parts of Paris, even if it has lost some of its old grandeur. It&rsquo;s great for those wanting to visit the hangout spots of folks like Hemingway and Gertrude Stein!</p></p>",
